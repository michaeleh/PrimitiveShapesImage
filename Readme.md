# Primitive Shapes Image

In this project i am going to attempt to recreate an image using a primitive abstract shape.
concretely using ellipses (up to 200).
In each iteration we are going to find the best ellipse which minimize the RMSE with the original value using Partical Swarm Optimization Algorithm.
After we found that ellipse we will draw it on top of the previos image and do the same thing again.
